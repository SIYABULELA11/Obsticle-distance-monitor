# Obsticle-distance-monitor
This a collaborative project that employs an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance to nearby objects in real  time. The Raspberry Pi continuously reads distance values and if an obstacle comes too close  (for example, less than 50 cm away), it sends a warning update to a client. This project implements communication between Raspberry Pi and computer using UDP.
The project is divided into mainly 2 parts hardware: setting up the raspberry pi and making the cable physical connections, Software part: the python code from the 3 differents files in this repository
This project is achieved with the work and ideas of my 10 other group members who showed amazing collaborative effort.
