# Obsticle-distance-monitor
This project employs an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance to nearby objects in real  time. The Raspberry Pi continuously reads distance values and if an obstacle comes too close  (for example, less than 50 cm away), it sends a warning update to a client. This project implements communication between Raspberry Pi and computer using UDP.
